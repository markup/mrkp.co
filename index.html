          This project included an identity revamp, using elements from a previously haphazardly kept brand, and executing several pieces (including a website, stationery, real estate signs, and business cards) in an approachable and consistent manner.

          V&oacute;rtice Online is an online, Spanish-language magazine on popular culture, focused on TV and films. It features essays, reviews and news, and has a strong knack for publishing on-going series exploring specific themes or formats. The design of the site is currently under revision, with a minor revamp on the way.

        <p>
          Originally designed by our colleague <a href="http://estudiointerlinea.com" title="estudio interl&iacute;nea">Alberto Rigau</a>, and developed for <a href="http://momentacreative.com" title="Momenta Creative | Communications for the Digital Age">Momenta Creative</a>, this website was built on WordPress. We delivered a robust WP theme that carries the branding guidelines set forth during the design phase, yet is flexible enough to allow Camera Bits staff to manage their company&rsquo;s website effectively.

        /markup is essentially a one-man operation run by <a href="http://twitter.com/agarzola">Alfonso G&oacute;mez-Arzola</a> (that would be the handsome fellow to the right). Alfonso designs and develops the front end of his client&rsquo;s projects, while collaborating with trusted back-end developers on select projects which require it. On occassion, he’ll collaborate with other designers who rely on his code-wrangling skills to bring their designs to fruition. This small yet collaborative approach keeps /markup&rsquo;s operation lean whilst retaining the capacity to handle complex projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alfonso has a background in print design. A self-taught designer, his unorthodox career path has led him to work with a variety of clients under several design firms. Most notably, he has worked with the United States Olympic Committee, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Museum of Contemporary Art of Puerto Rico, NJCAA, and Camera Bits; in collaboration with designers such as Alberto Rigau (estudio interlínea) and Mun Choi (Axio Design), as well as creative firm Momenta Creative, all of whom he still collaborates with regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
        On top of all this, Alfonso seems to have no qualms about writing of himself in the third person, although speaking of himself in this manner is yet to be observed. For more information, please use the contact form below to get in touch.
