        <h3>Developed for <strong>Camera Bits, Inc.</strong> &rarr; <a href="http://camerabits.com">camerabits.com</a></h3>
        <p>
          Originally designed by our colleague <a href="http://estudiointerlinea.com" title="estudio interl&iacute;nea">Alberto Rigau</a>, and developed for <a href="http://momentacreative.com" title="Momenta Creative | Communications for the Digital Age">Momenta Creative</a>, this website was built on WordPress. We delivered a robust WP theme that carries the branding guidelines set forth during the design phase, yet is flexible enough to allow Camera Bits staff to manage their company&rsquo;s website effectively.
